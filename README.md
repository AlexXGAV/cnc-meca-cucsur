The final project in Mechatronic Engineering at the University Center of the South Coast ([CUCSUR](http://cucsur.udg.mx/)) of the University of Guadalajara represents an exciting challenge that goes beyond a simple academic requirement. This project is the culmination of years of learning, dedication and passion for engineering, offering us as students the opportunity to surprise ourselves and the world with ingenious and creative solutions.

## The Purpose of the Final Project

The purpose of the final project is to apply the theoretical knowledge and practical skills acquired during the degree to address a real problem or design an innovative technological solution. Students have the opportunity to explore their specific interests in areas such as automation, robotics, numerical control, electronics, and more. By facing a real project, future mechatronic engineers gain valuable experience in complex problem solving, decision making and project management.
